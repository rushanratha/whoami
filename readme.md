# WhoAmI

This is not an implementation of the `whoami` command found on Linux/Unix platforms but just a project to learn iOS and rust development.

Within this project you will find a rust backend with a web api and an iOS app. The idea is for a user to register with the backend using a REST API and everytime the user reopens the app he/she will be welcomed.
